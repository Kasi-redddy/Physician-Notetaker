# 🩺 Physician Notetaker: Medical NLP & Sentiment Analysis

An AI-powered medical transcription assistant that analyzes physician-patient dialogues, extracts clinical insights, performs sentiment & intent detection, and generates structured medical summaries including SOAP notes.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project leverages NLP techniques to transform unstructured physician-patient transcripts into structured medical reports. It performs:

- ✅ Named Entity Recognition (NER) for symptoms, treatments, diagnoses, and prognoses  
- ✅ Medical keyword extraction  
- ✅ Sentiment & intent analysis (e.g., Anxious, Neutral, Reassured)  
- ✅ Automated SOAP note generation  
- ✅ User-friendly **Streamlit** web interface  
- ✅ No need for a local LLM – cloud-ready and lightweight

## 🖥️ Usage Instructions

1. **Paste a transcript** of a physician-patient conversation into the text box.
2. Click **"Analyze Transcript"** to extract:
   - Structured medical report (in JSON)
   - Medical keywords
   - SOAP note (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan)
3. Paste a **patient statement** separately and click **"Analyze Sentiment & Intent"** for emotional and intent classification.

## ✨ Example Outputs

### 🔹 Structured Medical Report

```json
{
  "Patient_Name": "Janet Jones",
  "Symptoms": ["Neck pain", "Back pain", "Head impact"],
  "Diagnosis": "Whiplash injury",
  "Treatment": ["10 physiotherapy sessions", "Painkillers"],
  "Current_Status": "Occasional backache",
  "Prognosis": "Full recovery expected within six months"
}
```

### 🔹 Medical Keywords

```json
[
  "Whiplash injury",
  "10 physiotherapy sessions",
  "Painkillers",
  "Back pain",
  "Neck pain",
  "Head impact",
  "Trouble sleeping"
]
```

### 🔹 SOAP Note

```json
{
  "Subjective": {
    "Chief_Complaint": "Neck and back pain",
    "History_of_Present_Illness": "Patient had a car accident, experienced pain for four weeks, now occasional back pain."
  },
  "Objective": {
    "Physical_Exam": "Full range of motion in cervical and lumbar spine, no tenderness.",
    "Observations": "Patient appears in normal health, normal gait."
  },
  "Assessment": {
    "Diagnosis": "Whiplash injury and lower back strain",
    "Severity": "Mild, improving"
  },
  "Plan": {
    "Treatment": "Continue physiotherapy as needed, use analgesics for pain relief.",
    "Follow-Up": "Patient to return if pain worsens or persists beyond six months."
  }
}
```

### 🔹 Sentiment & Intent Detection

**Input:**
```
I'm a bit worried about my back pain, but I hope it gets better soon.
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "Sentiment": "Anxious",
  "Intent": "Seeking reassurance"
}
```

## 🧪 Test Case Ideas

- **Symptom-based**
  ```
  Patient: I slipped on the stairs last week and twisted my ankle. It’s still swollen and hurts when I walk.
  ```

- **Reassuring sentiment**
  ```
  That’s a relief!
  ```

- **Negated symptoms**
  ```
  Patient: I have no pain, no discomfort, and no trouble sleeping.
  ```

- **Minimal description**
  ```
  Patient: I feel tired lately.
  ```

## 🧠 Methodology

### 🔍 Handling Ambiguity & Missing Data
- Use **negation detection** to reduce false positives.
- If data is absent, return **"Not specified"**.
- Prioritize clinician statements for critical fields.

### 🤖 NLP Techniques & Models
- **NER & Summarization**: `spaCy`, `SciSpacy`, `ClinicalBERT`
- **Sentiment Detection**: Fine-tuned BERT/ClinicalBERT models using supervised datasets
- **SOAP Mapping**: Fine-tune `T5` or `BART` with structured annotations or use rule-based segmentation.

## 📚 Datasets for Training & Fine-tuning

- **i2b2/UTHealth Clinical Notes**
- **MIMIC-III**
- **MEDIQA Dataset**
